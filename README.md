# Los Angeles Lakers 2023-2024 Season Performance Analysis 

## Goal of the Project 
The purpose of this project is to analyze the performance of the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2023 - 2024 NBA season using SQL. By importing game data from a CSV file sourced from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2024_games.html), we use SQL queries to extract valuable insights about the teamâ€™s performance, including:

```
Total wins and losses against each opponent.
Average scores for the Lakers and their opponents.
Average point differences in games.
Total overtime (OT) games.
Longest winning and losing streaks for each opponent.
```

## Data and Accessing the file
